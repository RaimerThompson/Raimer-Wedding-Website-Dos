      Hi, its me Ray, my own wedding was the start of my photography journey, that day was pivotal in me finding my true self, I literally said to myself that morning "Im going to live this day to my fullest without a care in the world of how I looked, acted, or sounded" and it was truly the greatest day of my life. Marrying my wife Grace was the best and smartest decision I've ever made (she's my bestfriend and tag team partner). I try to live my life every day giving as many hugs and positive vibes as I can to the world, and thats the attitude I bring to wedding day, engagement sessions, etc., I'm all about the positive aura and bonding with my couples. Its truly my hope and mission that on your special day you too can feel that you can live your day without worry, stress, anxiety and actually enjoy your day for what it is and allow your true personality to shine and allow your loved ones to see you for who you truly are.

        <h3>
          Take it from a man who originally didn't want anything to do with having a wedding and all the hoopla surrounding it, and that in turn after convincing from Grace had the best moment of my life and that day changed the course of the years to come. I get it! I get the nerves, the anxiety, the planning and overall logistics it takes to navigate this day. Having Lived it, Loved it, and would do it again a million times over, I understand how to navigate the day but more importantly I understand how to enjoy it to the fullest.
